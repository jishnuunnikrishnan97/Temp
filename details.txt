Here’s an enhanced version of your experience points, with more depth to highlight your suitability for the Full Stack Engineer role in the Renewables & Energy Solutions team. Each point aligns with the job’s focus on data handling, automation, and project-driven insights:

1. **Engineered and optimized OCR workflows** to automate the extraction of tabular data from high-volume PDF documents (both text and image-based) for a prominent bank, using Tesseract and OpenCV to pre-process data and PaddlePaddle OCR to extract structured tables. Designed custom constructors in PaddlePaddle for accurate data recognition, reducing manual data extraction time by over 50%.

2. **Deployed a REST API-driven application on Azure**, leveraging Python to pull, process, and serve real-time RBI circular updates. Integrated complex financial updates and projections into a centralized MIS dashboard, allowing stakeholders to access timely information without navigating multiple sources. This application, focused on data-driven insights, supported critical decision-making with daily updates and project-specific data projections.

3. **Automated data pipelines and process workflows** for two major banks using Python, Pandas, and PostgreSQL, transforming data handling into a highly efficient, repeatable process. Streamlined data cleaning, aggregation, and reporting, which reduced operational bottlenecks by up to 60%. Implemented PostgreSQL optimizations to improve database performance and ensure fast retrieval and processing of critical data.

4. **Collaborated closely with cross-functional teams** in dynamic project environments, translating complex regulatory and technical requirements into automated, scalable solutions. Partnered with Data Engineers and Data Scientists to ensure data workflows aligned with business needs and compliance standards, bridging technical gaps between development and deployment.

5. **Ensured compliance and data integrity in regulated banking contexts** by developing robust, automated data extraction pipelines for high-stakes data (like financial statements and compliance reports). Applied OCR and ML tools to ensure consistent accuracy, with validations to meet regulatory standards, contributing to audit readiness and reducing compliance risks.

6. **Developed expertise in data analytics for decision support**, using Python to generate insights and perform forecasting tasks that informed data-driven project decisions. Applied SQL queries in PostgreSQL to generate insights across large datasets, enabling faster responses to business inquiries and predictive analysis capabilities, especially useful in carbon credit forecasting.

These points give a fuller picture of your technical skills and achievements, emphasizing both your technical depth and your ability to create data-centric solutions in high-stakes, regulated environments. This should strongly align with the data-driven and cross-functional requirements of the Full Stack Engineer role in NBS.


Developed advanced computer vision models using CNN with YOLO for object detection (80% accuracy, 64% precision, 47% recall) and UNET for semantic segmentation (64.7% precision), automating annotation and validation processes across varied images.

Analyzed complex datasets with Python, SQL, and Excel to extract actionable insights, enhance business strategies, and presented findings through automated Tableau and Power BI dashboards for impactful data visualization.
